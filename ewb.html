									<h1>Rover and Drone for Crop Disease Detection</h1>
									<p>Northern Leaf Blight (NLB) is a disease commonly affecting maize plants, reducing yields by up to 60%.
                                        In 2013, NLB was the most damaging maize disease in the US, and continues to affect crops to this day.
                                        I'm working as part of my university's Engineers Without Borders Digital Agriculture team to create a dual drone and rover 
                                        system that can detect NLB in maize fields, helping farmers catch early onset of the disease so they
                                        can prevent its spread.</p>

                                <p>Our project is a proof-of-concept dual drone and rover system designed to detect early onset of NLB in maize plants.
                                   It is an entirely open-source project intended to help farmers in rural communities, especially those who lack the resources or money for advanced 
                                   commercialized technology. As such, it is designed to be easily built and its materials relatively inexpensive and 
                                   easy to acquire.
                                </p>
								<p>The project is split into four main components: the rover, the drone, the app interface, and the machine learning algorithm.
                                    First, the drone flies over the field and uses multispectral imaging to identify potential problem areas, as diseased
                                    plants absorb some light wavelengths differently than healthy plants. After potential problem areas have been identified,
                                    the farmer can use the app interface to plot a path for the rover to take in the field so that it can drive through 
                                    the problem areas and scan the leaves for signs of NLB.
                                </p>

								<p>NLB is characterized by large yellow-brown lesions on the leaves of the maize plant, which usually start occurring
                                    from the bottom up. The rover will use a machine learning algorithm to scan the leaves and identify leaves that show
                                    signs of NLB, flagging them so that the farmer can go in and manually review. Thus, the combination of rover and 
                                    drone system allows the drone to narrow down potential areas for the rover to do a more
                                    detailed inspection.
                                </p>
                                <p>As a member of the hardware team, I have been primarily working on the rover, which uses the open source JPL rover 
                                    build from NASA. We have currently completed most of the mechanical assembly, and are now working on electrical 
                                    and software system integration in order to get all the sensor inputs we need. This includes wiring and soldering 
                                    of components, as well as doing significant research on what sensors to buy and how we can connect them with
                                    our Raspberry Pi. Because this system is intended to be easily accessible, we need to stay as low-cost as possible 
                                    while still ensuring our intended functionality.
                                </p>
                                <p>We intend to complete our main functionality and begin testing by the end of this year-- stay tuned for updates on this page!
                                </p>
